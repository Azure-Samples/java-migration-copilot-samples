# Migrate a legacy Java EE Ant project to a Jakarta EE 10 Maven project

This workshop guides you through migrating a legacy Java EE Ant project to a Jakarta EE 10 Maven project. After completing the workshop, the project will be fully migrated from Java EE to Jakarta EE 10, upgraded from Spring Framework 5.3.39 to 6.2.x, and ready to build with Maven.

## About this Sample Project
